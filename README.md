As part of a preliminary interview process for a leading investment bank  extract the content of the blotter zip file which is included in this repo and improve the code as per the readme.docx instructions.
Here is the description of my solution:

The code was built with VS2017 (last update), .net framework version 4.8. The system.Reactive and System.Reactive.Core Nuget packages are required t run the code. 

The Blotter namespace contains classes that are responsible for the presentation of the Fx Blotter app. The app enables users to input currency pairs, and if a currency pair has a registered price source in the price source cache, it will display live simulated Fx prices for that currency pair. A currency pair can be entered more than once, and the price must match (it is derived from the same price source).

The original app had some code in the view in Blotter.xaml.cs, and it did not use an MVVM pattern. Additionally, the price source observable was not implemented, and the app used the task framework and a timer, which are not necessary when using RX. As a result, the code for the price source was rewritten to separate the dependency of the BlotterRow model from being directly linked to the price source. The WPF app was also rewritten while preserving the original behavior of the blotter, including the initial default currency pairs, their default prices, the available currency pairs, and the default null blotter rows, which are assumed to be there to allow entering new currency pairs.

The price source cache allows to use a single price source per currency pair and save memory whenever the users adds multiple blotter rows with the same currency pair.
In a real app, the price source cache would be a singleton that emits events to a topic in a message bus, allowing multiple subscribers to receive price updates from the topic.

Interfaces have been added to improve testability. 
I did not use dependency injection framework due to the limited time I had to complete this task over the weekend. 
Dependency injection can be added to improve inversion of control and manage the object lifecycle and instance creation. 

Description of the main classes in the blotter and the price supplier: 


**Price Supplier**
This reactive code provides a Price Supplier that allows subscribing to currency pair prices. It includes a PriceSourceCache class that implements the IPriceSourceCache interface and uses a dictionary to cache the prices of currency pairs. It also includes a static dictionary of available currency pairs and their default initial prices.

The PriceSourceCache class takes a function that creates an IPriceSource object (to improve its testability) and uses it to subscribe to the price updates of a currency pair. If the currency pair is not in the cache, it creates a new BehaviorSubject object with the default initial price and subscribes to the price updates of the currency pair. It then adds the BehaviorSubject object to the cache and returns it as an IObservable object.

The PriceSourceCache class also implements the IDisposable interface to dispose of all the BehaviorSubject objects in the cache when the object is disposed.

The PriceSource class implements the IPriceSource interface and generates random price updates for a given currency pair. It takes a string representing the currency pair and a decimal representing the initial price. If the currency pair is USDJPY, it sets the rounding to 2. It then creates a new CancellationDisposable object and a CompositeDisposable object to manage the subscriptions. It uses the Observable.Create method to create a new observable sequence that generates random price updates for the currency pair. It rounds the price to the specified number of decimal places and adds it to the sequence using the OnNext method of the observer. It then waits for a random amount of time between 50 and 2000 milliseconds before generating the next price update. If the sequence is cancelled, it completes the sequence using the OnCompleted method of the observer. It then subscribes to the sequence using the Subscribe method and adds the subscription to the composite disposable. It also adds the cancellation disposable to the composite disposable and returns it as the result of the Subscribe method.

This code uses the System, System.Reactive.Disposables, System.Reactive.Linq, and System.Threading.Tasks namespaces.

**BlotterViewModel**
BlotterViewModel is a class that manages the data and behavior of a blotter view, which displays simulated psuedo real-time prices for various currency pairs. The view model subscribes to a price source cache and updates the table with the latest prices for each currency pair. It also allows the user to add or remove rows from the table and change the currency pairs displayed in each row.

The  BlotterViewModel class depends on the following namespaces and libraries:
Blotter.Models : provides the BlotterRow  class used to represent a row in the blotter view.
PriceSupplier : provides the IPriceSourceCache  interface used to subscribe to real-time price updates for various currency pairs.
System.Reactive.Linq : provides reactive programming extension methods used to subscribe to price updates and throttle the rate of updates.
System.Reactive.Disposables: provides the CompositeDisposable class used to manage multiple subscriptions and disposing them
Usage To use the BlotterViewModel class, you need to create an instance of it and pass an 
IPriceSourceCache  object as input. You can also optionally specify a uiUpdateInterval parameter to control how often the view should be updated with the latest prices. Its not currently supported by the UI but sould be easy to implement should it be required.

var priceSourceCache = new MyPriceSourceCache();
var blotterViewModel = new BlotterViewModel(priceSourceCache, uiUpdateInterval: 100);
Once you have created the view model, you can bind it to a view that displays the blotter data. The view should bind to the 
BlotterViewModelRows property of the view model, which is an ObservableCollection  of BlotterRowViewModel objects. Each 
BlotterRowViewModel object represents a row in the blotter view and contains properties for the currency pair, bid price, ask price, and other data.

 <Grid>
        <DataGrid x:Name="Grid" AutoGenerateColumns="False" ItemsSource="{Binding BlotterViewModelRows}">
            <DataGrid.Columns>
                <DataGridTextColumn Header="Currency Pair" Binding="{Binding CurrencyPair}" IsReadOnly="False"/>
                <DataGridTextColumn Header="Price" Binding="{Binding Price, Mode=OneWay}"  ElementStyle="{StaticResource CollapsedIfZero}"/>
            </DataGrid.Columns>
        </DataGrid>
    </Grid>

The view can also interact with the view model by adding or removing rows or changing the currency pairs displayed in each row. To add a new row, the view should add a new BlotterRowViewModel  object to the BlotterViewModelRows collection. To remove a row, the view should remove the corresponding BlotterRowViewModel  object from the collection. To change the currency pair displayed in a row, the view should set the 
CurrencyPair property of the corresponding BlotterRowViewModel object.
